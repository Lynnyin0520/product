# Billing

When you use services, you will be incurring charges to a billing account. Billing accounts maintain your account balance and contain your payment information such as name, address, currency type, and tax ID.

## Billing Type

A account may have multiple billing account resources to control how the usage of services gets billed. This is done by linking the billing account to the service account you want it to pay for. Contect us if you need help setting this up.

Billing accounts exist in two flavors: **prepaid** and **postpaid**.

- Prepaid billing accounts maintain an account balance that you can easily top up using your preferred billing method.
- Postpaid billing accounts are paid via invoice.
